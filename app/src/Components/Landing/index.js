        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          I am an Engineering Leader and Software Developer with a PhD in Physics, a passion for innovation, and a mild
          obsession with data. I have a history of building and scaling engineering teams and Iâ€™m at my best when
          combining my technical and people skills to motivate and guide others.
          <br /> <br />
          While working in research, I focussed on statistical analysis and digging into different forms of data
          visualisation - trying to present complex concepts in a understandable way - which pushed me to delve deeper
          into programming. <br /> <br />
          After research, I spent 3 years as a technical recruiter, growing tech teams with some of the most innovative
          companies in the world. This inspired me to dive deeper into understanding technology and software development
          from a business context and now I am putting all these pieces together. <br /> <br />
          I enjoy the challenge of balancing technical and business requirements so that we can efficiently create
          exciting and robust products. Whenever possible, I am always looking to use a data-driven approach - for
          instance, to ensure our products are intuitive and easy to use. <br /> <br />
          In my spare time, I like to stay up to date by building small applications with JavaScript/Typescript and
          Python, improving my knowledge and skills in the area of machine learning and AI (a long term passion of mine
          - I refer you back to my mild obsession with all things data related), and reading and writing blogs relating
          to tech, leadership, and recruitment. You can read some of them on{" "}

          <br /> <br />I also enjoy getting involved and giving back to the tech community. I am a co-organiser of{" "}

          , an organisation runnning programming classes and events aimed at bringing more women into tech.
          <br /> <br />
          Overall, I just enjoy working with innovative technology alongside passionate people, and make a bit of a
          difference in the world.
