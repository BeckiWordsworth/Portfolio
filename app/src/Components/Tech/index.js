        I have always had a passion for solving problems with technology. Throughout my PhD and research career I built small solutions and analysed data with a variety of programming tools.
        <br/>
          <br/>
      Last year I decided to move from hobby programmer to professional, focussing on Javascript. I completed a bootcamp with Technigo where I did over 480 hours of coding, 50+ individual projects and group projects with companies such as Volumental, Bonnier, Comprend and Svenska Spel all within 3 months. <br/>
        <br/>
      Now I am working as a software developer building Full Stack solutions with React, Redux, Node, and MongodDB.
        <br/>
      <br/>
      In my spare time I also like to build small applications with Python and Swift, and improve my knowlegde and skills in the area of machine learning and AI. </p>
