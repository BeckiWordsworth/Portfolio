          Diabetes is commonly associated with chronic hypertension and evidence
          suggests that blood pressure control, even in the absence of tight
          glycemic control, can reduce the risk of diabetic complications in
          type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Hypertension is associated with raised
          capillary pressure which could provide a link between high blood
          pressure and the development of diabetic vascular complications in
          small blood vessels. Long term changes include stiffening of the blood
          vessels and, as a result, the cells feel less cyclic strain for a
          given luminal pressure. This leads to the question; is it altered
          pressure or strain that is important in reducing the risk of diabetic
          complications?{" "}

          Many existing models for exposing endothelial cells to mechanical
          forces in an in-vitro environment alter pressure and strain
          simultaneously, making it impossible to distinguish between the
          effects of the two potentially independent stimuli. This distinction
          is particularly relevant when examining the interaction of
          haemodynamic forces on microvascular endothelial cells, which are
          exposed to low hydrostatic pressure but significant strains.{" "}

          Part one describes the development of a haemodynamic model system that
          can eval- uate independently the impact of pressure (15 to 35mmHg) and
          strain (0 to 10%), com- mensurate with the microvasculature on
          microvascular endothelial cell function. A perfusion model was
          developed which allows accurate recording of pressures generated
          inside the system. A method for applying a continuous sinusoidal
          cyclical strain of 5-10% is discussed and the model is validated under
          these conditions for 48 hour periods. Part one also examines the
          growth and attachment of human endothelial cells in compliant tubing
          and presents a method for obtaining a confluent layer of cells in the
          tubing.{" "}

          Part two describes preliminary in vitro studies on the effect of
          hydrostatic pressure on microvascular endothelial cells and other
          major environmental factors in type 2 dia- betes, e.g.
          hyperinsulinaemia on the metabolic functions of microvascular and
          vascular endothelial cells, specifically fatty acid uptake.
          Preliminary studies indicated that chronic physiological insulin
          exposure inhibited the uptake of free fatty acids in human umbili- cal
          endothelial cells (HUVECs). Furthermore chronic exposure to raised
          levels of insulin reduced free fatty acid uptake further, which is
          contrary to studies on other cells lines. Ex- tending the study to
          microvascular cells, it was also shown that acute exposure to patho-
          physiological insulin levels stimulated free fatty acid uptake in
          human brain endothelial cell line (hCMECs).
